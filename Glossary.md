* [Data validation](https://www.mytutor.co.uk/answers/3636/GCSE/Computing/What-is-the-difference-between-data-verification-and-data-validation/) has nothing to do with what the user wants to input.

An example of this includes double entry of data (such as when creating a password or email) to prevent incorrect data input.
